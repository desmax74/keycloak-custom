<h3 id="success">Success</h3>

<p>Standard HTTP response codes are returned by the server indicating the outcome of the request. Please consult each REST service for their specific return code.</p>

<p>Here are the status codes most commonly used by our REST services:</p>

<p><code>200 Request succeeded
202 Your request to a POST or PUT was successful.
403 Access denied. This means you do not have the right permission 
    to invoke the service.
404 The resource was not found, this could be because there are errors 
    in the request parameters.
405 Usually this means you used the wrong HTTP method (e.g. GET instead 
    of POST).
</code></p>
